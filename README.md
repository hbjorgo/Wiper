# Wiper
Wiper allows you to recursively delete specified folders.

Say that you want to delete all 'obj' folders in a certain root folder.
Type in 'obj' as the folder name to delete and select the root folder.
Perform a dry run to list all folders that will be affected.
Hit the delete button and you're done!
